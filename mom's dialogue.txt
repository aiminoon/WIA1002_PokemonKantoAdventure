MOM:  You're leaving on your adventure with Pokémon? How
exciting! I know you've always dreamed of this day. Remember, the bond
you share with your Pokémon is the most important thing. Take care of
them, and they'll take care of you. Don't worry about me; I'll be just
fine here. I can't wait to hear all about your adventures and the new
friends you're going to make. Remember, no matter how far you go, I'm
always here for you. Be brave, be kind, and everything will turn out
just fine. I'm so proud of you already! Now, go on, your adventure
awaits! Oh, and don't forget to change your underwear every day! Safe
travels, my dear!"
